# Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Course Project Context

## What is HCI?

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field that focuses on designing computer technology that is effective, efficient, and satisfying for users. It involves understanding how humans interact with computers and creating interfaces that are intuitive, accessible, and provide a positive user experience.

## Our Project: Verdant Website

For our HCI course project, we're developing a website for Verdant, a fictional organization focused on sustainable industrial development in Indonesia. The website aims to connect innovators, investors, and stakeholders to support projects aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure).

## Project Requirements and Timeline

The project involves an iterative design process with multiple stages:

1. **Initial Proposal (Completed)**

   - Defined the problem: Connecting stakeholders for sustainable industrial development
   - Identified target users: Innovators, investors, industry partners, and the general public
   - Outlined a solution: A comprehensive website with various functionalities

2. **Data Gathering (Completed)**

   - Collected requirements through various research methods
   - Created a Product Requirements Document (PRD)

3. **User & Task Analysis (Completed)**

   - Analyzed stakeholders and defined specific user classes
   - Identified key tasks for each user type
   - Created use case diagrams and descriptions

4. **Activity Design & Paper Prototyping (Completed)**

   - Transformed use cases into activity diagrams
   - Developed interface metaphors
   - Created low-fidelity paper prototypes using Figma

5. **High Fidelity Prototyping (In Progress)**

   - Implementing a functional front-end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
   - Focus on visual design, layout, and basic interactions
   - Must implement at least 3 main features from activity diagrams

6. **Heuristic Evaluation & Prototype Revision #1 (Coming Up)**

   - Evaluate the prototype using Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics
   - Assign severity ratings to identified problems
   - Revise the prototype to address issues

7. **User Testing & Prototype Revision #2 (Coming Up)**

   - Test with at least 5 representative users
   - Use System Usability Scale (SUS) and User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ)
   - Make final revisions based on feedback

8. **Final Report and Presentation (Final Deliverable)**
   - Document the entire design process
   - Deliver an 8-minute presentation with live demo
   - Submit comprehensive final report

## Current Progress

We've completed the initial design stages and are now working on a high-fidelity prototype of the Verdant website. The current version includes:

- Multiple HTML pages with consistent navigation
- CSS styling for responsive design
- JavaScript for form validation and interactions
- Structured content for all key sections

## What's Next

We need to finalize our high-fidelity prototype by implementing and polishing the three main features that showcase core user interactions. After that, we'll conduct evaluations and make iterative improvements based on the findings.

## Key Evaluation Criteria

The course project will be evaluated on:

1. **Usability**: How easy and intuitive the interface is to use
2. **User Experience**: How satisfying the interaction feels
3. **Design Process**: How well we followed iterative design principles
4. **Implementation Quality**: How well the prototype functions
5. **Documentation**: How thoroughly we've documented our process and decisions

## Your Role

Each team member will contribute to different aspects of the project based on their strengths. We'll divide tasks related to design, implementation, evaluation, and documentation to ensure a comprehensive approach.
