# Human-Computer Interaction Course - Team Project Task Distribution

Based on the course requirements and our current progress with the Verdant website, here's a suggested task distribution for completing the remaining assignments. Each task should be assigned to specific team members based on their skills and interests.

## Current Project Status

We have developed a functional prototype for Verdant, a sustainable industrial development organization website. The website includes multiple pages, forms with validation, responsive design, and consistent navigation.

## Remaining Assignments and Task Distribution

### TA05: High Fidelity Prototyping (2 weeks)

**Overall Goal:** Complete a high-fidelity prototype implementing 3 main features/use cases.

**Tasks to distribute:**

1. **UI Refinement (1-2 members)**
   - Polish visual design elements (colors, spacing, typography)
   - Ensure consistency across all pages
   - Optimize for different screen sizes
2. **Form Functionality (1-2 members)**
   - Complete validation for all forms
   - Ensure success messages work properly
   - Test form submissions and error handling
3. **Interactive Elements (1-2 members)**
   - Implement any remaining JavaScript interactions
   - Ensure smooth transitions and animations
   - Add loading states for better user feedback

### TA06: Heuristic Evaluation & Prototype Revision #1 (1 week)

**Overall Goal:** Identify and fix usability issues through heuristic evaluation.

**Tasks to distribute:**

1. **Prepare Evaluation Materials (1 member)**

   - Create heuristic evaluation template
   - Document test scenarios for evaluators

2. **Conduct Evaluation (2-3 members)**

   - Perform heuristic evaluation using Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics
   - Assign severity ratings to identified issues
   - Document findings with screenshots

3. **Implement Fixes (All members)**
   - Prioritize issues based on severity
   - Implement fixes for identified problems
   - Document changes made

### TA07: User Testing & Prototype Revision #2 (1 week)

**Overall Goal:** Test the revised prototype with real users and make final improvements.

**Tasks to distribute:**

1. **Testing Preparation (1-2 members)**

   - Create System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire
   - Create User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ)
   - Recruit at least 5 test users that match our target audience

2. **Conduct User Testing (2-3 members)**

   - Guide users through test scenarios
   - Record responses and observations
   - Collect questionnaire data

3. **Data Analysis (1-2 members)**

   - Analyze SUS and UEQ results
   - Identify patterns and key issues
   - Create visualizations of findings

4. **Final Revisions (All members)**
   - Implement fixes based on user testing results
   - Document all changes made
   - Prepare demonstration for presentation

### TA08: Final Report and Presentation

**Overall Goal:** Document the entire design process and deliver a final presentation.

**Tasks to distribute:**

1. **Report Sections (divide among members)**

   - Problem statement and user analysis
   - Design decisions and iterations
   - Implementation details
   - Evaluation methodology and results
   - Reflection on process and learning

2. **Presentation Preparation (All members)**
   - Create slides for 8-minute presentation
   - Prepare demonstration of 1-3 sample tasks
   - Practice timing and transitions

## Communication and Collaboration

- Maintain all project files in the shared team drive
- Schedule weekly check-in meetings
- Use [chosen communication platform] for ongoing discussions
- Assign one team member as coordinator for each assignment
- Document all design decisions and their rationale

## Resources Needed

- User testing participants (minimum 5)
- Access to testing devices (desktop and mobile)
- Collaborative design tools (Figma, etc.)
- Analysis tools for SUS and UEQ
- Meeting space for team collaboration
